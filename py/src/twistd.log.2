2016-10-14 14:17:09-0400 [HTTPChannel,94,127.0.0.1] [1.0] Tell me another joke => A group of friars opened a florist shop to help with their belfry payments. everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of god, so their business flourished. a rival florist became upset that his business was suffering because people felt compelled to buy from the friars, so he asked the friars to cut back hours or close down. the friars refused. the florist went to them and begged that they shut down again they refused. so the florist then hired hugh mctaggert, the biggest meanest thug in town. he went to the friars' shop, beat them up, destroyed their flowers, trashed their shop, and said that if they didn't close, he'd be back. well, totally terrified, the friars closed up shop and hid in their rooms. this proved that hugh, and only hugh, can prevent florist friars.
