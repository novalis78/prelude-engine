(i had to configure my  data source to point at my access  through data source (), in the administrative tools folder (assuming you are running w2k/xp. on other windows operating systems i think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then i can't help you! :-) )  as for my i imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual . but that is a guess on my part. maybe someone else knows more about this?  there is a useful tutorial on the .sun.com website you're your interested.   hope that helps you out.</USER><BOT>when we will become friends we will know each other</BOT>

<USER>What is aiml</USER><BOT>The alice software implements aiml (artificial intelligence markup language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. the primary design feature of aiml is minimalism. compared with other chat robot languages, aiml is perhaps the simplest. the pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('') in patterns.  aiml is an xml language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. the choice of xml syntax permits integration with other tools such as xml editors. another motivation for xml is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with html experience. an aiml chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.</BOT>

(i had to configure my  data source to point at my access  through data source (), in the administrative tools folder (assuming you are running w2k/xp. on other windows operating systems i think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then i can't help you! :-) )  as for my i imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual . but that is a guess on my part. maybe someone else knows more about this?  there is a useful tutorial on the .sun.com website you're your interested.   hope that helps you out.</BOT>

<USER>What is the imitation game</USER><BOT>A game described by the british mathematician, alan turing. the game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an interrogator who may be of either sex. in order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. the object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. he knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." in order to confuse the interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the interregator with his answers. the woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. turing then asked the question, '"what will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? these questions replace the original, "can machines think?"'</BOT>

<USER>What is relativity</USER><BOT>In physics, the fact, principle, or theory of the relative, rather than absolute, character of motion, velocity, mass, etc., and the interdependence of matter, time, and space; as developed and mathematically formulated by albert einstein and h.a. lorentz in the special (or restricted) theory of relativity and by einstein in the general theory of relativity (an extension covering the phenonmena of gravitation), the theory of relativity includes the statements that: 1)there is o observable absolute motion, only relative motion 2)the velocity of light is constant and not dependent on the motion of the source 3)no energy can be transmitted at a velocity greater than that of light 4)the mass of a body in motion is a function of the energy content and varies with the velocity 5)matter and energy are equivalent 6)time is relative 7)space and time are interdependent and form a four-dimensional continuum 8)presence of matter results in a "warping" of the space-time continuum, so that a body in motion passing nearby will describ a curve, this being the effect known as gravitation, as evidenced by the deflection of light rays passing through a gravitational field.</BOT>

<USER>What is xml</USER><BOT>David bacon pronounces it "eggsmell". xml is the extensible markup language. like many "standards" in computer science, xml is a moving target. in the simplest terms, xml is just a generalized version of html. anyone is free to define new xml tags, which look like html tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context. aiml is an example of using the xml standard to define a specialized language for artificial intelligence.    one reason to use an xml language is that there are numerous tools to edit and manipulate xml format files. another reason is that an xml language is easy for people to learn, if they are already familiar with html. third, aiml programs contain a mixture of aiml and html (and in principle other xml languages), a considerable  convenience for programming web chat computers.   a good resource for information on xml is www.oasis-open.org.</BOT>

<USER>Whale tale</USER><BOT>S are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000 unsuccessfully trying to free a  dubbed churchill from fishing ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 s near here a few weeks ago prompted a lump in the national throat. the "save the s" ethos is almost unquestioned, and  and  risk becoming pariahs by continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy .  but it's time to put sentiment aside. the "save the s" campaign against all commercial ing was necessary a few decades ago, after ing had devastated all large species. even today, there are fewer than 10,000 s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and s may become extinct.  but it is equally true that restrictions on ing, including a moratorium on all commercial ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some  stocks. the u.s. national  service estimated in 2000 that there are more than two million s worldwide. the international ing commission calculated years ago that there were more than 900,000 s and 780,000 s worldwide, and the numbers are higher now. milton man, a ing expert at the university of alberta, estimates that the number of s has trebled over 30 years and that  are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent annually.  indeed, the number of s (which came off the endangered species list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones began washing up on west coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed. the best guess is that the numbers of  grew, the food supply shrank and malthus had his way.  the bottom line is that while most large s remain at risk, for some species we can no longer argue that we need to "save the s." they've been saved.  at a time when there's talk about overing, it's also worth pointing out that s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as much as humans. there is speculation that rising numbers of s may be holding down the population of s that compete for similar food.</BOT>
